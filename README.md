# scheduleAhead

Designed a simply day planner utilizing Jquery & Local storage to dynamically create elements with interactive features. Colors in the planner will change during every change of the hour (@ local time) from 9 AM to 5 PM. User information, typed into any future time blocks can be saved and will persist in local storage. If user types information into a past or current time block, the save button will not function since you cannot make plans for past events.
